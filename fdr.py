def false_discovery_control2(ps, *, axis=0, method='bh'):
    """Adjust p-values to control the false discovery rate.

    The false discovery rate (FDR) is the expected proportion of rejected null
    hypotheses that are actually true.
    If the null hypothesis is rejected when the *adjusted* p-value falls below
    a specified level, the false discovery rate is controlled at that level.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ps : 1D array_like
        The p-values to adjust. Elements must be real numbers between 0 and 1.
    axis : int
        The axis along which to perform the adjustment. The adjustment is
        performed independently along each axis-slice. If `axis` is None, `ps`
        is raveled before performing the adjustment.
    method : {'bh', 'by'}
        The false discovery rate control procedure to apply: ``'bh'`` is for
        Benjamini-Hochberg [1]_ (Eq. 1), ``'by'`` is for Benjaminini-Yekutieli
        [2]_ (Theorem 1.3). The latter is more conservative, but it is
        guaranteed to control the FDR even when the p-values are not from
        independent tests.

    Returns
    -------
    ps_adusted : array_like
        The adjusted p-values. If the null hypothesis is rejected where these
        fall below a specified level, the false discovery rate is controlled
        at that level.

    Notes
    -----
    In multiple hypothesis testing, false discovery control procedures tend to
    offer higher power than familywise error rate control procedures (e.g.
    Bonferroni correction [1]_).

    If the p-values correspond with independent tests (or tests with
    "positive regression dependencies" [2]_), rejecting null hypotheses
    corresponding with Benjamini-Hochberg-adjusted p-values below :math:`q`
    controls the false discovery rate at a level less than or equal to
    :math:`q m_0 / m`, where :math:`m_0` is the number of true null hypotheses
    and :math:`m` is the total number of null hypotheses tested. The same is
    true even for dependent tests when the p-values are adjusted accorded to
    the more conservative Benjaminini-Yekutieli procedure.

    The adjusted p-values produced by this function are comparable to those
    produced by the R function ``p.adjust`` and the statsmodels function
    `statsmodels.stats.multitest.multipletests`. Please consider the latter
    for more advanced methods of multiple comparison correction.

    Examples
    --------
    We follow the example from [1]_.

        Thrombolysis with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA)
        and anisoylated plasminogen streptokinase activator (APSAC) in
        myocardial infarction has been proved to reduce mortality. [4]_
        investigated the effects of a new front-loaded administration of rt-PA
        versus those obtained with a standard regimen of APSAC, in a randomized
        multicentre trial in 421 patients with acute myocardial infarction.

    There were four families of hypotheses tested in the study, the last of
    which was "cardiac and other events after the start of thrombolitic
    treatment". FDR control may be desired in this family of hypotheses
    because it would not be appropriate to conclude that the front-loaded
    treatment is better if it is merely equivalent to the previous treatment.

    The p-values corresponding with the 15 hypotheses in this family were

    >>> ps = [0.0001, 0.0004, 0.0019, 0.0095, 0.0201, 0.0278, 0.0298, 0.0344,
    ...       0.0459, 0.3240, 0.4262, 0.5719, 0.6528, 0.7590, 1.000]

    If the chosen significance level is 0.05, we may be tempted to reject the
    null hypotheses for the tests corresponding with the first nine p-values,
    as the first nine p-values fall below the chosen significance level.
    However, this would ignore the problem of "multiplicity": if we fail to
    correct for the fact that multiple comparisons are being performed, we
    are more likely to incorrectly reject true null hypotheses.

    One approach to the multiplicity problem is to control the family-wise
    error rate (FWER), that is, the rate at which the null hypothesis is
    rejected when it is actually true. A common procedure of this kind is the
    Bonferroni correction [1]_.  We begin by multiplying the p-values by the
    number of hypotheses tested.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> np.array(ps) * len(ps)
    array([1.5000e-03, 6.0000e-03, 2.8500e-02, 1.4250e-01, 3.0150e-01,
           4.1700e-01, 4.4700e-01, 5.1600e-01, 6.8850e-01, 4.8600e+00,
           6.3930e+00, 8.5785e+00, 9.7920e+00, 1.1385e+01, 1.5000e+01])

    To control the FWER at 5%, we reject only the hypotheses corresponding
    with adjusted p-values less than 0.05. In this case, only the hypotheses
    corresponding with the first three p-values can be rejected. According to
    [1]_, these three hypotheses concerned "allergic reaction" and "two
    different aspects of bleeding."

    An alternative approach is to control the false discovery rate: the
    expected fraction of rejected null hypotheses that are actually true. The
    advantage of this approach is that it typically affords greater power: an
    increased rate of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is indeed false. To
    control the false discovery rate at 5%, we apply the Benjamini-Hochberg
    p-value adjustment.

    >>> from scipy import stats
    >>> stats.false_discovery_control(ps)
    array([0.0015    , 0.003     , 0.0095    , 0.035625  , 0.0603    ,
           0.06385714, 0.06385714, 0.0645    , 0.0765    , 0.486     ,
           0.58118182, 0.714875  , 0.75323077, 0.81321429, 1.        ])

    Now, the first *four* adjusted p-values fall below 0.05, so we would reject
    the null hypotheses corresponding with these *four* p-values. Rejection
    of the fourth null hypothesis was particularly important to the original
    study as it led to the conclusion that the new treatment had a
    "substantially lower in-hospital mortality rate."
