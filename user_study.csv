The story is somewhat developed. It involves complex concepts, such as the idea of a life being controlled by a higher power and the effect of unfinished stories. The plot is intricate, with the protagonist's life put on hold and the emotional consequences of this situation. The characters are realistic, experiencing hope, anxiety, and doubt. The story also has an underlying history or circumstance (the unfinished story) and precise descriptions. However, it does not reach the levels of complexity found in a well-thought-out story, as it lacks some of the additional elements found in higher-rated stories, such as an intricate plot, precise descriptions, and an underlying history or circumstances.",1,0,1,0,0,1

However, the character is not completely involved with the reader, and the story lacks a strong emotional connection. This is why I rate it a 3.",1,0,0,0,0,0
